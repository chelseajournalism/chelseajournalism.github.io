              Throughout March, underclassmen and teachers may have wondered why many seniors were covering their masks with hands and having wardrobe malfunctions. This odd behavior was all because of the senior game, Cypher. Following yearly tradition, which took a two-year break due to online learning, the Class of 2022 spent a month of their final semester at Lynbrook playing Cypher, with two free prom tickets worth $300 at stake and some final lasting memories to make.

              Fluttering flags spin through the air and over the heads of the winter guard members who threw them. In the blink of the eye, the guards move seamlessly into the rest of the choreography. Such a maneuver is only one of the many skills winter guard performs, and winter guard’s well-choreographed performance captivates the audience by telling a story with vivid visual aspects.

              Like many recent internet jokes among teens, the popularity of school Instagram pages originated on TikTok before spreading to high schools all over the U.S, including those within FUHSD. A variety of accounts were quickly born from this trend, some with an immense following: @lynbrooksleeps features Lynbrook students napping at school, @fuhsd.bathroomfeet showcases photos and videos of FUHSD students’ shoes and @fuhsdposturecheck displays FUHSD students’ bad posture. Although the anonymous administrators of these pages may only intend to provide students with a quick laugh, they should be aware of negative effects such as cyberbullying and harassment can easily arise from such pages.
