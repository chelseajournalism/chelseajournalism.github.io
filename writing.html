              On the red rubber track of the 2022 Stanford invitational, Lynbrook’s girls varsity 4×100 team sped through the finish line with a time of 47.82 seconds, not only topping their personal records but also trumping Lynbrook’s all-time record of 48.06 seconds from 1978. This year’s groundbreaking time landed seniors Alyssa Meng, Alison Tjoe, Vanessa Su and Claire Wang in first place in the Central Coast Section League and eighth in the ranks of all high school California teams.            </div>

              Throughout March, underclassmen and teachers may have wondered why many seniors were covering their masks with hands and having wardrobe malfunctions. This odd behavior was all because of the senior game, Cypher. Following yearly tradition, which took a two-year break due to online learning, the Class of 2022 spent a month of their final semester at Lynbrook playing Cypher, with two free prom tickets worth $300 at stake and some final lasting memories to make.

              Fluttering flags spin through the air and over the heads of the winter guard members who threw them. In the blink of the eye, the guards move seamlessly into the rest of the choreography. Such a maneuver is only one of the many skills winter guard performs, and winter guard’s well-choreographed performance captivates the audience by telling a story with vivid visual aspects.

              Like many recent internet jokes among teens, the popularity of school Instagram pages originated on TikTok before spreading to high schools all over the U.S, including those within FUHSD. A variety of accounts were quickly born from this trend, some with an immense following: @lynbrooksleeps features Lynbrook students napping at school, @fuhsd.bathroomfeet showcases photos and videos of FUHSD students’ shoes and @fuhsdposturecheck displays FUHSD students’ bad posture. Although the anonymous administrators of these pages may only intend to provide students with a quick laugh, they should be aware of negative effects such as cyberbullying and harassment can easily arise from such pages.

Local student artists are the visionaries behind these pieces, thinking outside of the box to add color to our commutes by painting the most unexpected and often overlooked objects: power boxes.

              In-store or online shopping is a common leisure activity, but it is also a method of stress relief that many people engage in, both consciously and unconsciously. Retail therapy, the act of buying something with the intention of lifting one’s mood, provides shoppers with psychological rewards and is a proven outlet for releasing feelings of negativity. However, the behavior can develop into an unhealthy coping mechanism if one’s impulsivity goes unchecked.

              I always remind myself, “Fake it ‘till you make it.” But I’m no actress. I’ve been fighting my introversion for years, trying to pretend that I’m an outgoing, charismatic person who is comfortable with who she is. Yet everyone I knew still saw me as the same quiet girl, reticent and reserved.
